v 1.3

* Added ``BlockGrid.animate`` attribute and ``BlockGrid.flash`` method
  to facilitate animation of grid changes in the Notebook.
* Added `Pixel` and `ImageGrid` subclasses that behave more like image
  manipulation libraries.

  index and color.

v 1.2

  will have coordinates (0, 0).

* Raise a TypeError when indexing a ``BlockGrid`` with a length one tuple
* Added a ``Block.colors`` property

* Python 3 support (thanks to Thomas Kluyver)
* ``for block in grid`` style iteration
* ``Block`` now has an HTML representation for displaying individual blocks
* ``__str__`` methods on ``Block`` and ``BlockGrid``
* Ability to control block size via ``block_size`` keyword and attribute
  on ``BlockGrid``
